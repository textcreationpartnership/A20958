            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No, no: leaſt it may be ſaid to us as in <hi>Proverb.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have called and ye refuſed. I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Ye have ſet at naught all my counſell, and would none of my reproofe. I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mocke when your feare commeth: when your feare commeth as deſolation, and your deſtruction commeth as a whirle-winde, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe and anguiſh commeth upon you.

For the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperitie of fooles ſhall destroy them. Remember what I did to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorrha,</hi> 4.

But even now inſtantly, without putting it off, let us no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane this ſo ſpeciall a gift of God. This moſt precious gift I ſay, of repentance, <hi>(which Eſau beg'd yea even with teares, and it was not graunted him Heb.</hi> 12.17.) For feare leaſt that befall us which was ſaid to the five fooliſh Virgins, who becauſe they wanted oyle, when they had leiſure to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19333:108"/> have made their proviſion thereof, entred not in with the bridegroome, and let us ſtand on our gards, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in newneſſe of life, as having already left this world, not knowing the houre when we ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of it: Witneſſing that we are dead unto ſin, and liuing unto God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. in whom we are made new creatures, to ſerve unto righteouſneſſe: And doe ſhew that truly we have more care of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove then of theſe which are upon the earth, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the covetous to his

Hence is the root and the ſpring, this is that which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them, and which fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them. What wil not the covetous man do to augment his heape of wealth? The ambitious to enjoy his ambition? The voluptuous to accompliſh his deſires? Their hearts being in theſe things, as if in them conſiſted their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraine happines.</p>

To wind up all in brief; appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it not that they that take their pleaſure in theſe things, ſpare not the very honour of God, which they annihilate and utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as much as in them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to give place to their irregular and diſordered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? For although
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19333:109"/> they know, and are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his will, and how he ought to be obeyed and ſerved; they voluntarily ſeduce and miſlead them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the way of ſalvation, and hold (though againſt their conſcience) the great and wide way of the world: the way of thoſe, which in their hearts they reproove, and know they ſerve not the Lord as they ſhould: And with them often ſerve the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (yea their owne work) in ſtead of the Creator, call upon it (or faine to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it) committing Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with all ſuperſtition, (at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt in hypocriſie) &amp;

Why then, theſe vices, draw they not after and with them this full meaſure of all wickednes, for what is this but ſo to renounce God? Yea often times to make warre againſt him? Can man with all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie conceive a thing more abhominable? No, no; it is not poſſible, this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt it ſhould fare with them, as with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

                  <p>A doome it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and truly remarkable of all other: <hi>That the way of the foole is right in his owne eyes, Proverb.</hi> 12.15, Silly ſots, to think by your humane wiſdome (fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before the Lord) to take Sanctuarie, and better to ſhelter your ſelves from

Whilſt you endeavour to make men believe another thing then that which you have inwardly in your heart: that deteſtable vice,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19333:112"/> which our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt never ſpeakes of without expreſſion of his anger: the high way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19333:112"/> to mens demeanours, and then is he truly a ſpirituall leper: For having loſt the feeling and feare of Gods juſtice, it is a ſure teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that ſuch an one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God; becauſe to denie God, and to denie his juſtice is all one. Indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares it not that the moſt of them, who at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but fainingly ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Idolaters, at length become wholly Idolaters, or fall into that blindnes, that there's no longer any religion at all in them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving altogether forgotten God, and live as though there were no God, of whom many that would

                     </p>
                     <p>Now unto them that are ſuch, the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that all things worke together for good, afflictions, ſickneſſes, death it ſelf: All are turned unto them by the grace of God unto their great good and profit, to ſerve unto the furthering of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſpeciall
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19333:149"/> fruits which God cauſeth us to reape from our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and afflictions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us out of our ſinnes. In health and in proſperity, it is a thing too ordinary with us to flatter and to lull our ſelves aſleep in our ſinnes, by reaſon of the great corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which maketh us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable unto all evill, and unprofitable unto all good. Very neceſſary then is it for us to be awakened and to be made ſenſible of our ſinnes, to be diſpleaſed with them, and to recover our ſelves out of them. All
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19333:150"/> which is wrought by the meanes of ſickneſſes, and other adverſities of this life, which are the iſſues of ſinne, and oftentimes are ſent unto us from God to chaſten and correct us for our ſinnes. And therein our gracious heavenly Father ſheweth how he loveth us, withholding us by this meanes that we periſh not in our diſſolutions, as a good Father, and one that loveth his children, he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth them, and gives them the rod, when need requires it to ſtay them, they run not upon their owne deſtruction. This is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19333:150"/> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. That <hi>when we are afflicted wee are chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Lord, that wee ſhould not be condemned of the world.</hi> And elſwhere he ſaith (Hebr. 12. ver. 6.7. &amp; 11.) <hi>That the Lord cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth him whom he loveth, and ſcourgeth every childe, he approoveth; if you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer chastiſement</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God preſenteth himſelfe unto you as unto his children: For what ſonne is he whom the Father corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth not? And although all chastiſement for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time ſeemeth not to bee joyous, but grievous, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe afterward it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the peaceable fruit of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:19333:151"/> righteouſnes unto them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Wee muſt then in the firſt place gather this excellent fruit of our ſickneſſes to have a ſenſible apprehenſion by them of our ſo many and ſo grievous delicts, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof we ſtand guilty before God, to the end to crave pardon for them with repentance and humility, and to make unto him an holy proteſtation to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And behold how the maladies of our bodies are unto us thorough Gods grace, good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome medicines for our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond benefit ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes brings us, is to unlooſe, and pluck up our hearts from the earth, to lift them up unto heaven.</p>
                     <p>Experience ſhewes us that our hearts remaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much faſtened and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here below, whilſt we are here in health and at our eaſe, we could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent never to budge hence. Nay, we could be content our felicity were here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us, and our ſoveraign
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:19333:152"/> happines, ſo farre are wee blinded. But God who hath ordained us for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life, makes us ſee and feele how vaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable are the ſweet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements and imaginary proſperities of this mortall life, when it pleaſeth him to croſſe it thus with ſicknes, and with ſo many miſeries and diſcomodities, which accompanie us therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, from the cradle to the grave. This makes us know, yea maketh us cry out with <hi>Eſay, ch.</hi> 47. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>That all fleſh is as graſſe, and the glory thereof as the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the field.</hi> With <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> Pſalm. 90.6. <hi>That the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19333:153"/> flower of this ſhort life is ſuch that men are in perpetuall travell and martyrdome.</hi> And with Iob, chap. 14. <hi>That man that is borne of a woman is of ſhort life, and fraught with ſorrow.</hi> And this is it God putteth us in mind of chiefly, when we feele our ſelves ſick, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe afflicted, to make us contemne the earth, and to aſpire up unto heaven, to cauſe us to diſtaſt this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, &amp; to make us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and heartily to reliſh and meditate on the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, to the end, that there where our treaſure is, there alſo might bee our heart: and that our faith
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19333:153"/> and hope might be weaned from the world, and from the things of the world to be raiſed up thither where they have their true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, unto God, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life: For alſo faith is not of things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but of inviſible: And hope is not of good things preſent, but of good to come; that is to ſay, of good celeſtiall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, obtained in Ieſus Chriſt, good ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently great, and ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor hath entred into the heart
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19333:154"/> of man, that which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is yet a third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruit, which God makes us reape from the ſickneſſes, he ſendeth us: that is, that by this meanes he puts us to triall, and to the touch-ſtone, to purifie and to amend our faith, to make it eminently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to his glory, and to the edification of our neighbour. For as by this meanes our faith is ſtirred up and elevated from the world unto God, from the earth unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from this life unto a life moſt happy and laſting
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:19333:154"/> for ever: as alſo is it by ſuch tryalls exerciſed and examined, and as it were refined and made more pure after the manner of gold, which is tryed and purified by fire: Even as Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. It is alſo by this meanes drawn forth into evidence, and ſet in the light, with patience, conſtancie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian vertues, which God hath infuſed into us, and which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without this would not be knowne of any, and thereby would remaine without uſe, and without profit in regard of our neighbours. And indeed
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19333:155"/> we could not know what was the faith, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Iob,</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and of ſuch a number of other excellent ſervants of God, if God had not made them paſſe thorough the fire of ſundry temptations and tryals, and we ſhould not have at this day the worthy examples which we have to lead us to conforme our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their imitation. It fareth with the faith and patience of Chriſtians, as with the courage and valour of the ſouldier, which is not well ſeene, but in the midſt of the battell: As with the light of the Starres, which
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19333:155"/> appeares not but in the night: As with the odour and ſweet ſmell of frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, which is not ſmelt, but when it is caſt into the fire. Even ſo doth God make knowne unto our brethren the courage which he hath given us, when he cauſeth us to come into the hands of ſome rough and violent ſicknes; he maketh to appeare unto them the brightnes of our faith, when he ſpreadeth over us ſome night of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, he maketh them ſmell the good perfume of our patience, when he caſts us into ſome fire of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie; and by this meanes
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19333:156"/> our brethren not onely are inſtructed, edified, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our good example, but withall led to praiſe and glorifie God, who it is that ſuſtains and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us amidſt the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our fleſh, ſheweth forth and perfecteth his great ſtrength in our great weaknes.</p>
                     <p>Lo then the principall and more remarkable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fruits, which God of his goodnes propounds unto us to be reaped from our bodily ſickneſſes.</p>
                     <p>And for this cauſe then, Sir, now that God viſits you with this ſicknes, and layes you on this bed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19333:156"/> you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is his fatherly hand, that handles you on this faſhion, as one of his children, and that hereby he calls you to the fruition of theſe excellent fruits and benefits, which have been declared unto you, for his glory, and for your good and ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledge then that he would awaken you from out your faults and ſinnes, that he would have you to have a feeling of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to breed in you a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of them, that ye might ſeek for the free pardon of them in his mercy, thorow Ieſus Chriſt, that you may
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:19333:157"/> renounce them with your whole heart, to take a ſound reſolution to ſerve him from henceforth, and to walk in his feare with more zeale and affection then heretofore thorough his grace. Is not this that which you promiſe?</p>
                     <p>Yes.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledge further, that it is his will to make you by this meanes to haue a feeling of the miſeries of this life, to contemne, and trample under foot the world and the vanities thereof, to the end to aſpire with your whole heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heavenly and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, and thereby to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19333:157"/> anſwer unto the dignity of that condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you are called, to be the child of God, and not the child of the world; to have your converſation as a Citizen of heaven, and not of the earth, and thereby to have you to ſeeke as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. The things that are aboue, and not thoſe that are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And is not this alſo the thing which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt you will do all the dayes of your life, Gods grace thereunto aſſiſting you?</p>
                     <p>Yes.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledge you laſtly, that the good pleaſure of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19333:158"/> God is to trie and examine you by this ſicknes, to the end that your faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience might be made more perfect, and that they might be ſeen and known of your brethren and neighbours, that they might thereby be edified and comforted, and might thereby give glory to God, when they ſhall ſee that you ſhall beare pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and conſtantly the ſorrow, and the violence of this affliction, and that you ſhall diſpoſe and apply your ſelfe to reſt with a calme and peaceable mind, in all and whatſoever hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhall pleaſe God to impoſe upon you with his
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19333:158"/> fatherly hand. Is not this alſo moreover the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you take?</p>
                     <p>Yes.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech God, give you grace thorowly and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accompliſh your holy promiſes, to his glory, and your owne ſalvation. It is your part alſo to pray unto him for the ſame, with your heart; otherwiſe you can never be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it of your ſelfe. But if you ask it fervently with a true and lively faith in the name of his welbeloved Sonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, doubt not but that according to his promiſes he heares you, yea from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19333:159"/> this very time forward he is neare unto you, and fils your ſoule with holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, ſtrengthening you with patience, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſolacing you as much as he ſhall know it to bee neceſſary for you, and by that meanes by ſo much the more will he oblige you to rejoyce and ſolace your ſelfe in his goodnes, and to glorifie his holy Name by thankſgiving. And this is it which he ſaith himſelf unto you, and unto whomſoever is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as you are, <hi>call upon me when thou ſhalt be oppreſſed, and then will I helpe thee, and thou ſhalt honour me for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:19333:159"/> the ſame.</hi> Would you not then have us now addreſſe our prayers altogether joyntly with you, that it would pleaſe him to aſſiſt you with his grace?</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:19333:160"/> or mercy from thee, and are worthy of the lower-moſt hell: if thou ſhouldſt deale with us in the rigour of thy juſtice, by reaſon of the numberleſſe number of our ſinnes and offences, wherewith we feele and confeſſe our ſelves tainted and guilty before thee. But we beſeech thee (that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regard to thy great and infinite goodnes, thou wilt be mercifull unto us poore ſinners, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto us for thy deare Sonne Chriſt Ieſus ſake our Lord, looking upon us not in our ſelves; but rather in the perſon of that Sonne of thy love, as members of his

And as thou art the Father of Mercy, and God of all conſolation, rich in compaſſion and free grace towards all them that call upon thee, and put their truſt in thee. We beſeech thee be graciouſly pleaſed to ſhew unto us thy plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous mercy both towards us, and generally upon us all that now call upon thee for thy grace, and particularly towards the perſon of this thy child and ſervant, lying on this his bed of infirmity. Give him to acknowledge in the firſt place, that he is not ſtrucke by any other
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:19333:161"/> hand, but by thine; that he may learne to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto, and under the ſame in all humility and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And to this end, let him remember that it is a fatherly and a ſweet hand, which ſtrikes not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but rather to ſave: and who after he hath wounded, healeth and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth by the ſame wounds which he hath made. Make him to ſeele that he is a poore and miſerable ſinner, not onely to be iſſued forth of that maſſe of corruption out of which we are all ſprung in <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo and chiefly becauſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it pleaſed thee to give

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:19333:162"/> himſelf: even as our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes are infinite, by which we fight ordinarily againſt thy bountifulnes and grace. O God and Father, touch him then in his heart with a lively ſenſe of all his infirmities and offences, that without any way flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of himſelf, he may eſcape and be freed from condemnation before thy ſacred Majeſtie, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that unto thee belongeth juſtice, and to himſelfe confuſion of face: may be altogether diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at, and wholly deny himſelfe, and may confeſſe that juſtly and by good right thou doſt lay upon

But withall make, Lord, this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment to ſerve onely to humble him, and not to precipitate him into the gulfe of deſpaire, and that he being on the one ſide beaten downe, and dejected to the earth by thy mighty hand, not ſo much by the ſenſe of this ſicknes, as in the ſenſe and feeling of his

But it is not upon our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, which is none at all, that we found any ſuch
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19333:175"/> aſſurance, but even upon the righteouſneſſe of him, whom God <hi>hath made to be ſinne for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. that is to ſay, a ſacrifice for ſinne: <hi>to the end that wee might bee the righteouſneſſe of God in him: and by whoſe obedience we are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, in ſtead as by the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Adam wee were ſinners, Rom.</hi> 5.19. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point which might make us overweening in this behalfe, might be this. If we preſumed to acquire and get any ſuch knowledg of our ſalvation by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and acutenes of our owne ſpirits or wits: it being ſo, that <hi>the naturall
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19333:176"/> man perceiveth not the things which are of God,</hi> thus ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.14.

That by this meanes <hi>we apprehend the will of Christ. Now by

                     <p>IN the meane time, I am not ignorant, that your faith, how great and ſtrong ſoever it may be, may yet for all that be ſmall and weake in you: For during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of this life, the Holy Ghoſt is but given you in a certaine meaſure, according to the which we know but in part, and our ſpirituall renovation is but yet here begun. Certaine it is, we cannot attaine here below unto the perfection of faith. And therefore I
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:19333:183"/> doubt not but your faith yet is infirme and weake, and cannot chuſe but be toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſundry temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and skirmiſhed with divers aſſaults of doubts and diſtruſts. But you muſt not therefore ſhrinke or bee creſt-fallen in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: For this combat you feele in yourſelfe, it is the fight, which as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. is in the ſoule of every faithfull one, between the fleſh and the ſpirit, and therefore it is unto you an aſſured teſtimonie that you have faith. For as the fleſh fighteth in you by diſtruſt, the ſpirit alſo fighteth in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:19333:183"/> you by faith; and this faith will never yeeld it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backt and ſuſtained by the ſpirit of God, which will make it victorious. And how imperfect ſoever it be, God will make it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto you unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For it is not ſaid, he that ſhall believe perfectly, ſhall be ſaved, but rather ſimply, he that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Beſides as you feele in your ſelf your faith weak and imperfect, ſo I doubt not, but you therewith feele an holy deſire, that it might be ſtrengthened and increaſed, and that your heart prayeth and maketh requeſt unto God for the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:19333:184"/> ſame. Is it not true?</p>
                     <p>Yes, it is.</p>
                     <p>Now ſith it is ſo, this faith, this deſire that it might be increaſed, and this prayer you make for it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, are not theſe fruits of the ſpirit, and not of the fleſh? And ſeeing they are the fruits of Gods Spirit produced in you; is not this a ſure teſtimonie that you are led by the ſame, and by conſequence the child of God? For all they that are led by the Spirit of God, are the children of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.</p>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:19333:187"/> no ſinne, there can be no death. And indeed, as for eternall death, which the Scriptures call <hi>the ſecond death,</hi> you have from it a full and a perfect releaſe by the meanes of this faith, which God hath given you. <hi>

                     <p>And as for the death of the body, whereunto we remaine ſtill ſubject, it is not unto the faithfull a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:19333:187"/> of Gods anger upon them, as it is ever ſuch unto the reprobate, but rather a great and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular favour of his bounty, and which bringeth them an infinitenes of excellent commodities. Firſt of all it delivereth and ſetteth us free from all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and dangers, putting an end unto ſuch a number of miſeries, vexations and griefs, which exerciſe and diſquiet us unceſſantly both in our bodies and in our mindes, during the courſe of this miſerable life, or rather of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall death, wherein we languiſh here below: and

                     <p>Secondly, corporall death is an entrance to us into a true life, by the benefit of Ieſus Chriſt, who hath himſelfe paſſed thorow this death, to make the paſſage happy and dangerleſſe unto us: it is a ſafe bridge unto us, to paſſe us and convay

This is the happineſſe which your ſoule ſhall injoy even from your very inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this body. And as for your body, which ſhalbe put into the earth, this ſhall not be for it, there to periſh for ever, but rather there to reſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time in expectation of a bleſſed reſurrection:
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:19333:189"/> For this cauſe is it, that the death of the faithfull is called <hi>a ſleepe</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they are called, <hi>they that are aſleepe,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their bodies, which at the laſt day ſhalbe awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and raiſed up out of the duſt, to poſſeſſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their ſoules glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious immortality, being made conformable unto the glorious body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:19333:195"/> of thy great compaſſions, and the perfect obedience which thy deare Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord hath performed unto thee in our name, with whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe we beſeech thee to cover and adorne us with thy grace, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row him, and in thy favour we may be reconciled and acceptable. But now we beſeech thee, O good God, be pleaſed particularly to impart this great mercy unto this thy poore child and ſervant, caſt downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy mighty hand, a poore ſinner indeed, and ſuch a ſinner as ſhould for ever remaine overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Lord, thou knoweſt better then he himſelf, or we, either whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more expedient for him, that he ſhould live, or die. If thy good pleaſure be he ſhall live, let it be that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:19333:196"/> he may live wholly unto thee: So as that having well profited by theſe thy chaſtiſements; he may learn to love thee, to honour, and ſerve thee all the dayes of his life in the midſt of thy Church, by ſtudying perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually therein to bring forth the fruits of pietie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines worthy of thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and beſeeming the child of ſuch a Father, and the ſervice of ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: And ſo thou mayeſt be glorified in him, and his neighbours edified. But if otherwiſe it be thy will to take him out of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable world, give him aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it ſhalbe to put
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:19333:197"/> him in poſſeſſion of thy heavenly kingdome; which thou haſt prepared for him before the foundation of the world, and which thy Son hath purchaſed for him by the merit of his death. To this end, O Father of light, from whom deſcendeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good and perfect gift, be pleaſed to give unto him a true and a lively faith, wherewith he may ſeeke, find, and lay hold on thy mercy for his ſins, and true righteouſnes in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame thy deare Son Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>who was delivered up unto death for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our juſtification:</hi>

Let not his ſinnes then plunge him into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:19333:198"/> ſeeing they have been ſo fully payed and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied unto thy juſtice, not by gold or ſilver, but by the precious bloud of thy Chriſt, as by that Lamb without ſpot and blemiſh.

Let not Satan daunt him any more, ſeeing he cannot hurt him, but by ſinne and death, the dominion whereof he hath loſt in his behalfe: Aſſure him in the end, that in vain that accuſer ſhall lay ought to his charge at the throne of thy juſtice, ſeeing that he being already abſolved and juſtified by thy grace,

Ieſus Chriſt was crucified as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, upon the tree of the Croſſe, to deliver you, from the eternall curſe. Ieſus Chriſt died ſhedding forth his bloud, his precious bloud, to waſh you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem you, to deliver and wholly ſet you free from the death of hell, and from the power of Satan. Ieſus Chriſt was buried in the

                     <p>Now, F. S.

                     <p>F. S. N. Ieſus Chriſt ſaith with his own mouth, that all things are poſſible unto him that believeth. Believe then (without doubting at all) that Ieſus Chriſt putting on our fleſh, was made true man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

For ſeeing he is for you, none ſhalbe againſt you: for Ieſus Chriſt, who is the Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh, hath overcome all for you: He offered up himſelfe once for you, and by the ſame ſole oblation hath wholly aboliſhed all your ſinnes.

                     <p>Now ſith it is ordained by God that all men ſhall die, we cannot reſiſt his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: rather we ought evermore to conforme our ſelves to his holy will. Wherefore my brother, you muſt not think it ſtrange, if I declare unto you the ſame which the good Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto King <hi>Ezechias,</hi> ſaying unto him from the Lord, Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, &amp; not live. This good advice ought to ſtirre you up tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:19333:236"/> to ſet your ſelfe in good order, ſpiritually, in your conſcience. And that is firſt of all to convert and turne you unto God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile your ſinnes, as that good King did: To implore his mercy, in begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at his hands, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes in your heart, Lord God, be propitious and mercifull unto me poor miſerable ſinner, for thy Sonne Ieſus Chriſt his ſake my Lord and Saviour. And then you muſt not forget your houſe and familie, which you ought ſo well to ſet in good order, and ſo to diſpoſe of by a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament and laſt will, that it
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:19333:237"/> may remaine in peace and tranquillitie after you. But the better to give you to underſtand how to diſpoſe aright and to ſet in order your houſe, it is, that you give unto every one what belongeth unto him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defrauding of any man: that you leave your wife endow'd with what is due to her, your children and kinsfolkes in good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and charitie: that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your deceaſe they may have no occaſion to fall to diſſention and diviſion. This being done, you muſt quite forget all worldly eares, and affection to the world, which paſſeth away
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:19333:237"/> withall the concupiſcence thereof. But he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever. Touching your children, you are only their naturall father for a time: but God is perpetually their Spirituall Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in his holy kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and protection, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſuſtaine them, to keep and deliver them from all evill, whilſt they will but walk in his wayes. Beſides in that you are a Chriſtian, regenerate in the holy Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; long ſince you knew that we have not here any Citie of continuance: for we looke for a better then
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:19333:238"/> this; which is eternall. Wherfore I pray you in the Name of God, that you diſquiet not your ſelfe for any affection you may have to this world: For here we are all but ſtrangers, as our fathers, when as then the Lord God ſhall have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and decreed that you muſt diſlodge, flit, and go before us, will not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelf unto his holy will and ordinance? As on the other ſide, if he ſee it expedient for your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prolong unto you your life, as he did to that good King <hi>Ezekias,</hi> would you not content your ſelfe with whatſoever it ſhall
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:19333:238"/> pleaſe him to do with you? Yes aſſuredly: for he is Lord and Maſter, you are but his ſervant. He is your Creator, you are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the work of his hands. For this cauſe then will he diſpoſe of you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will.
